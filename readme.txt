An application to notify when a network device gets connected to Unifi Network application!
I have tested it on UCG Ultra which runs Unifi Network application.

You will need:
    1. Unifi Network application
    2. Telegram API token and chat-id

How this works:
    This docker based application runs as syslog server and you will have to configure your Unifi Network application to send syslog to this app!

This app will create a logs and will store two kinds of logs:
    1. Application log: Logs generated by this application
    2. Syslog: Row data received from the Unifi Network application

This app will create two json files:
    1. unifi_dhcpack_status.json: Which has detials of each netowrk client gets connected to your Unifi Network application
    2. notification_history.json: Which has details of notifications generated by this app and sent to Telegram app

This app has web GUI:
    Web GUI can be access locally by the IP:PORT as per configured by the config.yaml file
    Typically: 192.168.1.100:8085
    These are URLs which gives some useful information!
        http://192.168.1.100:8085 This will give the history of the connected network clients to your Unifi Network application
        http://192.168.1.100:8085/datetime This will give the history of the connected network clients to your Unifi Network application (sorted by datetime desc)
        http://192.168.1.100:8085/ip This will give the history of the connected network clients to your Unifi Network application (sorted by IP address)
        http://192.168.1.100:8085/reconnect This will give the history of the connected network clients to your Unifi Network application (sorted by reconnect count desc)

        http://192.168.1.100:8085/notifications This will give the all history of the notifications generated by this application (sorted by datetime desc)
        http://192.168.1.100:8085/notifications/?last=100 This will give the last 100 history of the notifications generated by this application (sorted by reconnect count desc)
